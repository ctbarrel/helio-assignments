Question Answers
1. Why are ID selectors a bad Idea?
I can't say why they are a bad idea, but I know that class and element are both better. Element selectors select elements and edit all of the elements of the same tag. It is less specific and can be a simple catch-all to maintain style elements throughout a page. Class selectors, on the other hand, can take the place of ids selectors but also have multiple put on the same element.
2. What selectors should you prefer when working with CSS?
See my answer above. Specifically, class is the most important selector.
