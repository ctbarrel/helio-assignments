Why use Promises here?
    It allows us to set the order of events,
    pausing the code until it resolves the
    current function.

What benefits for breaking functions into own resource?
    Separation of Concern. It is a lot easier to manage
    them and find the code you are looking for if you
    ever need to edit it, rather than searching through
    one mega-file, you can look in a smaller, specific
    file.

Other functionality of Separation of Concerns?
    You can send some parts of your code, but not others.
