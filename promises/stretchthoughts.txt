A promise is an object that, when read, returns a 
Boolean value and can be used to return a different
value through .then and .catch, .then with true, and
.catch with false.

Promises are used by setting it up, then consuming it.
The set up looks like a function beginning with "new
Promise", then is "consumed" using other functions
based on .then and .catch.

The main benefit of using a promise to avoid nesting
callback functions, aka Callback Hell. It allows for
a far more vertical code.
